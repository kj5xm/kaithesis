%% The text of your acknowledgement and nothing else (other than comments)
%% goes here. It will be single-spaced and the rest of the text that is
%% supposed to go on the acknowledgement page will be generated by the
%% abstractpage environment. This file should be \input (not \include 'd)
%% from cover.tex.

This is the acknowledgement section.
\par
You should replace this with your own acknowledgements.
