%% beam, target, HRS magnet, detector package. DAQ.
Experiment E05-110 (Coulomb Sum Rule) was run in Hall A at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia. It is a single arm inclusive quasi-elastic experiment. During E05-110, continuous electron beam was scattered on a set of H, He, C, Fe, Pb target. A pair of High Resolution Spectrometer(HRS) are used independently. The detector package on left and right HRS are simialar, except a NaI Calorimeter is installed on left arm, and on right arm calorimeters were preshower and shower. Data and information from beamline detectors and HRS were stored in database by Data Aquisition System.
